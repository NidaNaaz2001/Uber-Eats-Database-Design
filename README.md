# Uber-Eats-Database-Design

In this project, A database system for Uber Eats was designed. For this, first we needed to conduct research about the domain and collect data requirements (how system works, what piece of data needs to be stored to support given functionalities, what are the main entities/components of the system, how different entities interact with each other etc.) And, we tried to design a database system as realistic as possible. This means, assumptions complied with real-world situations/scenarios.
